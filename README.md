<h2 align="center"><strong>HRV Breathing Pattern - App Repository</strong></h2>

This repository contains the source-code for the [HRV Breathing Pattern](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bauerapps.breathpatternmeasure)-App in the Google PlayStore. 

## Purpose of the App

For the purpose of presenting test-candidates with a paced-breathing indicator, this *Android-App* was developed. Because of the specific requirement for the Application, non of the preexisting *Android*- or *iOS*-Apps were suitable.
It was e.g. necessary, to concatenate multiple breathing phases and to change between them, without needing to reconfigure breathing-parameters for the following phase.

Therefore, an independent App was developed, which offered the above mentioned requirement. The reason to develop an Application for the Android-Operational System (OS) instead of targeting Apple-iOS devices was mainly because it is more comfortable to publish Applications in the Google *PlayStore* than in the Apple *AppStore*.

Building an Android-App requires a certain level of knowledge in object-oriented programming. However, this report will not cover these fundamentals, as there are many sources available on the Internet to learn the basics of programming Applications for Android.

Since 2017, *Kotlin* is an official programming language for Android and a considerable alternative to the previous supported language, *Java*. Kotlin offers many coding advantages over Java. Thus, the App *HRV Breathing Pattern* is written in pure Kotlin. The App is available in the Google PlayStore, and the Sourcecode was added to this repository.

## Installation from Google PlayStore
When using Android, I'd recommend to refer to the Google Playstore for the Free App: [HRV Breathing Pattern](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bauerapps.breathpatternmeasure)

## Installation from Source
To install the App from source, [**Android Studio**](https://developer.android.com/studio/) is required. To understand the concepts and steps that are involved in the Development process, take a look at the [App Basics](https://developer.android.com/guide/) Section from the Documentation at Android Studio.
