# HRV Breathing Pattern - App Repository
This repository contains the source-code for the "HRV Breathing Pattern"-App in the Google PlayStore

For the purpose of presenting the test-candidates with a paced-breathing indicator, an *Android-App* was used. Because of the specific requirement for the Application, non of the preexisting *Android*- or *iOS*-Apps were suitable.
It was for example necessary, to concatenate multiple breathing phases and to change between them, without needing to reconfigure breath-parameters for the following phase.

Therefore, an independent App was developed, which offered the above mentioned requirement. The reason to develop an Application for the Android-Operational System (OS) instead of targeting Apple-iOS devices was mainly because it is more comfortable to publish Applications in the Google *PlayStore* than in the Apple *AppStore*.

Building an Android-App requires a certain level of knowledge in object-oriented programming. However, this report will not cover these fundamentals, as there are many sources available on the Internet to learn the basics of programming Applications for Android.

Since 2017, *Kotlin* is an official programming language for Android and a considerable alternative to the previous supported language, *Java*. Kotlin offers many coding advantages over Java. Thus, the App *HRV Breathing Pattern* is written in pure Kotlin. The App is available in the Google PlayStore, and the Sourcecode was added to this repository.
